# Beacon

This is a project as part of University of West Florida's Capstone course. Our team was tasked with developing, from beginning to end, a software application that changed or aided the ways people communicate.

Our response, which we call Beacon is a social medium of places. It is an Android application where users can create, view, and share pins, dubbed beacons, on a map. These beacons are places that users find interesting and want others to discover; maybe, it's a art installation, a new building, or that poor bird lying dead on the sidewalk.

This project was developed by the No Bugs Allowed Team. Members include Gerald Beinhauer, Charlie Redding, and Jonathan Ingram.

This repository includes the following folders and files:

- src - source code for the project
- man - user's manual and installation instructions
- con - conceptual work and mockups used for development
- doc - supporting documentation for the project, including our final report
- README - the file you are currently reading
